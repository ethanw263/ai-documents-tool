You are a legal contracts analyst. Extract only the actual clause titles from the legal contract text below.

ðŸ›‘ Do NOT include any extra content, trailing words like "In Process", or body text â€” only the literal headings as they appear in the document. Some of these appear as a watermark or gray text across the screen so forget those and grab the headings correctly.

Each heading should:
- Appear exactly in the text
- Be one short line
- Represent a contract clause

DO NOT make up or summarize anything.
Only return clause headings â€” no bullets, numbers, or formatting.

Return the list as plain text, one title per line.
